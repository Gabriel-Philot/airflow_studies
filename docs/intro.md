# What is Airflow ?

The Apache Airflow is an open-source data workflow and orchestration platform founded in 2014 by Airbnb.

Airbnb's initiative to develop Apache Airflow reflects the increasing complexity and demand for efficiency in data management. Just as a symphony requires a conductor for each instrument and section, data pipelines require scheduling, monitoring, and precise coordination. Without this orchestration, data processes can conflict, leading to delays, data loss, or catastrophic failures. 

Understanding the context behind Airflow's necessity allows readers to better appreciate its importance and impact. Just as an audience eagerly awaits the conductor's entrance before a performance, we can anticipate the moment when Apache Airflow takes the stage, bringing order and efficiency to the chaos of data workflows.

Imagine Apache Airflow as a skilled conductor leading an orchestra of data. Just as a conductor coordinates different instruments to create musical harmony, Airflow orchestrates various data processes into a cohesive workflow.

At the beginning of the data concert, Airflow's conductor calls the right musicians to the stage, represented by data extraction tasks fetching necessary information from diverse sources. Like a vigilant conductor, Airflow ensures each "instrument" (or task) starts at the right moment, establishing dependencies between them to ensure the workflow progresses smoothly and efficiently.

As the concert progresses, Airflow's conductor closely monitors the progress, ensuring each note is played at the right time. It maintains the rhythm of the data flow, scheduling tasks to execute at the most appropriate moments, ensuring the data process is completed on time and accurately.

Similar to a conductor leading a memorable performance, Apache Airflow guides data processes with reliability, scalability, and extensibility. It empowers users to create complex data symphonies, allowing them to shape the workflow according to their needs and monitor progress in real-time. With Airflow, the data stage transforms into a spectacle of efficiency and control.


Let's delve into the key structures of Apache Airflow and how they work together seamlessly to orchestrate data workflows.


> ➡️ DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) serve as the backbone of Airflow, akin to musical scores organizing the notes of a piece. Within Airflow, they represent workflows as directed graphs, where each node denotes a task and edges indicate dependencies between tasks. Just as in music, each note (or task) is crucial for the overall harmony.

> 👷 Operators function as the performers executing tasks outlined in DAGs. They define what needs to be done at each stage of the workflow, such as executing SQL, transferring data, or sending emails. Each operator contributes its unique skill to the overall performance.

> 📆 Schedulers and Executors play the roles of conductors and the orchestra, ensuring tasks are executed at the right time and efficiently. The scheduler schedules task execution based on dependencies and specified timings, while the executor carries out the scheduled tasks, whether locally, in clusters, or in the cloud.

> 🌐 Plugins act as special additions to Airflow's repertoire, enhancing its capabilities by adding new operators, connections to external systems, or customizing the user interface. Plugins enrich the user experience, providing more options and flexibility.

> 💾 Metadata and Databases function as the concert's record and score sheets. They store crucial information about DAGs, tasks, and executions, enabling state control, monitoring, and execution history logging. These metadata form the foundation for ensuring data operations' consistency and reliability.


By integrating these structures within Airflow's technological context, we can visualize how it elegantly coordinates data processes, creating a symphony of efficiency and control. Each element plays a vital role, contributing to the smooth and successful execution of data workflows.
